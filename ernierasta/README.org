TODO: update it to reflect my approach when layout becomes somewhat stable.

Otherwise, I use one-shot modifiers, and layers accessed via holding thumb keys.
On the layers, I mostly try to keep the keys on the opposite hand to the one
holding the modifiers (like Miroyoku), but there are a few exceptions where it makes sense to
have a key on a particular layer and there's no room for it on the chosen side.

I also use combos for enter, tab, escape, backspace and delete, as well as all
the brackets, which are mostly on the home row.

I have modified [[https://github.com/mattgemmell/qmk_firmware][Matt
Gemmell's]] ~update-keymap-diagram.py~ script so that it would work with my layout,
and that generates the image below.
